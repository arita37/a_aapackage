## You need to download the dataset from [here](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/urbansound8k.html)

And the audio processing library I used is [Librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/index.html)

It got feature extraction, wave visualization, onset detection, effects, outputs and so much more.
