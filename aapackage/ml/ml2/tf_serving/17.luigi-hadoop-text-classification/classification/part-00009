believe me i was furious when our socialist i cant roll my eyes at that hard enough president took single payer off the table before anyone even had to ask him to take it off the table we should have nationalized healthcare like every other civilized nation on the planet but apparently my fellow americans just dont want it theyre barely willing to tolerate the incredibly mild reforms in the aca hell people are furious at the president because their terrible fake insurance is being replaced by cheaper insurance that actually insures them but but but you said i could keep eating dirt and paying for the privilege if i wanted liar liar weve been trying for single payer since teddy roosevelts day and it got him kicked out of his own party this sort of everything new is pantspissingly terrifying mindset is why we still wont use the damn metric system as much as i think my country needs single payer realistically i have to admit that the majority of us apparently dont want it so ill take whatever petty improvements we can get: negative	1

i prefer it im a texan and a while back i had a horrible kidney stone but i didnt know what it was because i had never had one before i went to the er in excruciating pain and they treated me wonderfully i got three count em baby three shots of morphine through an iv that is an experience i have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend then i left with a handful of prescriptions after a ct scan is that right some kind of scan and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again woo so then the bill comes and its 8000 so at first i was all like woah shit so i called and complained because while in the er i had specifically ask repeatedly how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors nurses radiologists or whatever theyre called and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay as much as i could afford right now i authorized 50 because she wouldnt explain to me what exactly it was i was paying for right now and i finally decided they just wanted a card on file sooo when the bill comes the scan alone was 6000 bucks just the scan the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which i would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care i got and i knew i was uninsured going into this and i knew ers are expensive and at the time i was in horrible pain and scared shitless by it so i didnt care i made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for just the scan that seemed unreasonable to me and i also found out later that scans like that arent necessary for kidney stones and often arent done unless youre peeing blood so wtf so this is where the fun starts i called to complain about this scan cost i was quite clear that i would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but i couldnt afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if i qualified for financial relief from my bill i explained again that i didnt want charity i just wanted a reasonable bill and btw 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too 800 of that is called an er fee and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the er regardless of what happens next but hey they took good care of me and i dont know what the fuck morphine costs anyway the only option i had was to file for the charitable relief well ya see i am currently a stay at home uncle my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom she cant afford day care you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is and since i made less money than she does i become the stay at home parent we all live together now she pays the bills and i take care of the kids it was weird at first but its actually kinda rewarding and fun now most of the time so technically im single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that actually do have some income for contract it work with people who knew me before i quit its all under the table though soooo i got full relief i actually have some money and my mother actually makes ok money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time lower is better of course but i had braced myself to accept 4 grand if i could negotiate hard enough to get there instead i paid 0 and i learned a valuable lesson if it looks like you have no money you can go to the er for freeeeee wee so suck it tax payers i ripped you off for 8000 bucks and i have three pain pills left over for a rainy day now stupid obamacare is going to make me pay for my own insurance boooo thats going to be like 70 a month every month you even have to pay in december come on government its baby jesus birthday fucking dicks: negative	1
