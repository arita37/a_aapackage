## Training

```

################### Install

1) install mini conda

2)
conda create -n py36 intelpython3_full -c intel

pip install -r  pip_freeze.txt

tensorflow 1.13.1


################## Files
main.py : Main file


config.py :  configuation file

solver.py :
   file where the graph, train is defined.
   

equation.py 
where the dynamic is written.



################## How it works.

Sample generator   bdse.sample generates time series sample of X :  4D tensor stacked in 3D format.
   X[ nsample,
      ndim_x   :   3 for 3 assets,
      0...T : time steps
     ]
     
   We feed X into a sub-network.
   For each time step, sub-network predicts some value Z ( a tensor of dimension  (nsample, nim_x).
       
   We use z to calculate other values :  w (weights ) and p ( linear weight * X values).    
       
   Final Loss is    the total variance over time of P  + Regualization.
   
     
################## What we need to do :
 1) We want to test many scenarios equation.py/scenarios  and store automatically in a timestamp folder for runs.
    We can analyze easily all scenarios results after.
     
    Add some code to store all the convergence results of weights w.
        w[   nsample,  ndim_x,  0..T ]  steps.
    
    
 2)  Scenaruios is generated by :
          # allret, .....y, iidbrownian = gbm_multi(nsimul, nasset, nstep, T, s0, vol0, drift, 
          #          correl, choice="all",)

          allret, allpaths,..... = gbm_multi_regime(nsimul, nasset, nstep, T, s0, vol0, drift, 
                    correl, choice="all", regime=[0,1,2])


 3) We want to improve convergence results of weights :
     replace Xt by   VAR[X , over 0..t] helps
