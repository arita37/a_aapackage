# Library dependencies for the python code.  You need to install these with
# `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you can run this.

#### ESSENTIAL LIBRARIES FOR MAIN FUNCTIONALITY ####

# Neural net and related libraries.
# keras==2.0.5
# h5py
# scikit-learn


tensorflow==1.13.1
scipy==1.2.1


## Tensorflow Requirements ##
# Tensorflow is required to run this code but depends on specific configurations. Install from:
# https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#overview
# If you want to use the GPU version, you will also need Nvidia's CUDA toolkit and cuDNN:
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
# Note that if you want to use the GPU version, you have to `pip uninstall tensorflow`
# and `pip install tensorflow-gpu`, since both cannot coexist.
tensorflow>=1.0.1
